      <h2>How Did Chipotle Start?</h2>
      <p>Chipotle menu has grown significantly since its beginnings in 1993. It all started with the founder, Steve Ells, who opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado. Initially, the menu was simple and focused on burritos, tacos, and salads.</p>
      <p>These early offerings highlighted fresh ingredients and a customizable approach, where customers could pick and choose their fillings and toppings.</p>
      <p>As Chipotle grew in popularity, so did its menu. In the early 2000s, the company began to expand its offerings to include more variety while still maintaining its commitment to using high-quality, responsibly sourced ingredients.</p>
      <p>This expansion included the introduction of items like carnitas (slow-cooked pork), barbacoa (spicy shredded beef), and sofritas (tofu-based protein option), chipotle catering to a wider range of tastes and dietary preferences.</p>
      <p>Throughout its history, Chipotle has also experimented with limited-time menu items and seasonal specials, keeping the menu fresh and exciting for customers. These innovations have often been influenced by consumer trends toward healthier eating and sustainability, reflecting Chipotle’s mission to serve “food with integrity.”</p>
      <p>Today, the Chipotle menu continues to evolve and offers a selection that includes traditional Mexican fare alongside modern interpretations and innovations. Chipotle remains committed to providing fresh, flavorful food that satisfies both taste buds and conscience.</p>
